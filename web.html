<h2>With the evolution of the international laws in the last 100 years,concept of unristricted sovereignty has weakened </h2>
<p class="main">The human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) following the dilution of Article 370 and the passage of the <i>Citizenship
 (Amendment) Act (CAA) </i>have brought renewed international focus on India’s human rights practice. Responding to criticism made by 
 the United Nations agencies and others, the Indian state asserted that both J&K and CAA are entirely internal matters and there 
 cannot be any interference in such sovereign decisions.</p>
<br><!-- used for line break-->

 <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhat is remarkable about modern international human rights law is its recognition of individuals as subjects. Classic international 
 law governed the conduct between states and did not recognise the rights of individuals. Countries made agreements on the premise that
 a sovereign state had the exclusive right to take any action it thought fit to deal with its nationals. Such a notion of absolute sovereignty
 was challenged in 19<sup>th</sup> century with the emergence of humanitarian intervention to protect minorities living in other states. Later, in 1919,
 the evolution of labour standards led to the establishment of the International Labour Office (ILO). In 1926, the Slavery Convention adopted 
 by the League of Nations prohibiting slave trade heralded the first human rights treaty based on the principle of dignity of a human being. 
 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948 by the United Nations, was the first comprehensive international human rights document.
 The Universal Declaration has acquired the force of law as part of the customary law of nations. It has provided the basis for binding human 
 rights treaties and non-binding guidelines/principles that constitute a distinct body of law known as international human rights law.
</p>
<h4>HUMAN RIGHTS</h4>
<p>Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the
 foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous
 acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech
 and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people,
 Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and 
 oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law,Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly
 relations between nations,Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human
 rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social
 progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with
 the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,Whereas a common
 understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,
 Now, Therefore THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims THIS UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS as a common standard of achievement
 for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly
 in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national
 and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States
 themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.</P>
<P> All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards
 one another in a spirit of brotherhood.Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without
 distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
 property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or
 international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing
 or under any other limitation of sovereignty.Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.
 No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.No one shall 
 be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishmentEveryone has the right to recognition everywhere
 as a person before the law.All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the
 law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement
 to such discrimination.Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating 
 the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law.No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.
 Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination 
 of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against hiM.</p>


<h3>Unstainable claim</h3>
<p class="main">This progress of international law in the last 100 years makes the Indian state’s assertion of its sovereign right unsustainable.
 The evolution of international human rights law is also about the gradual weakening of the concept of unrestricted sovereignty.
 The Indian government has ratified several international human rights treaties and submits periodic reports to the respective treaty bodies. 
 By doing so, it has acknowledged the principle that the treatment of its citizens is not entirely an internal matter, and such measures do not enjoy an absolute sovereignty.</p>
<h3>Weakening of the civil society</h3>
<p>While responding to criticism against its human rights practices, the Indian government also refers to the role of free media and
 civil society in protecting the human rights of vulnerable groups. However, in the context of J&K and the ongoing struggle against 
 the CAA, the media has not come out any better. As for civil society organisations, the government since 2014 has systematically targeted 
 them, including by making it difficult for them to receive funds from foreign donors. Since 2014, the government has cancelled the registration
 of about 14,000 NGOs under the <b>Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA)</b>. It has also mainly targeted its own critics.</p>
